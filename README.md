The AI-Powered Music Player is a smart web app that lets users search and 
play songs using voice commands. After secure login or signup, users access a 
modern interface featuring humanoid robot design. By clicking a microphone 
button, users can speak the song name, triggering a listening animation. The 
system then searches the local music library and plays the requested track. The 
song currently playing is displayed, along with real-time playback controls. User 
data is securely stored in a MySQL database, offering a seamless and AI-driven 
music experience.
